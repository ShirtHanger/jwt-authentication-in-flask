Initialize a new virtual environment inside your project directory and install Flask and pythons postgres library:

pipenv install flask psycopg2 python-dotenv

If that does not work try this 

pip install flask psycopg2-binary python-dotenv

Create an app.py file by running the following command in your terminal:

touch app.py


python3 app.py

To deactivate the virtual environment when youâ€™re done, simply type:

exit
